Since the binary is prefixed with `git-`, Git also recognizes it as a subcommand:

```bash
git wtm
```

## Features

### Worktree Manager

- **Visual worktree list** — see all worktrees with branch, status, commit info, and sync state at a glance
- **Smart add** — type to search existing branches or create new ones inline, auto-generates paths
- **Status tags** — colored labels: `PRIMARY`, `ACTIVE`, `UNSAVED CHANGES`, `clean`
- **Quick actions** — add, remove, open terminal/editor, fetch, prune
- **Detail view** — full commit info, ahead/behind counts, file change breakdown
- **Folder picker** — browse for a path using your OS file manager (`Ctrl+O`)

### Branch Manager

- **Browse all branches** — scrollable list with tracking status and sync info
- **Checkout** — switch branches instantly
- **Create / Rename / Delete** — full branch lifecycle management
- **Merge** — merge any branch into current
- **Tags** — `ACTIVE`, `remote`, `local only` with ahead/behind indicators

### General

- **Tabbed interface** — switch between Worktrees and Branches with `←` `→`
- **Search/filter** — instant filter in both tabs with `/`
- **Loading states** — visual feedback while fetching data
- **Cross-platform** — macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Version flag** — `git-wtm --version`

## Keybindings

### Global

| Key | Action |

| `←` / `→` | Switch between Worktrees and Branches tabs |
| `/` | Search / filter |
| `?` | Toggle full help |
| `q` | Quit |
| `Ctrl+C` | Force quit |

### Worktrees Tab

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓` | Move down |
| `k` / `↑` | Move up |
| `Enter` | View worktree details |
| `a` | Add worktree |
| `d` / `x` | Remove worktree |
| `o` | Open terminal in worktree |
| `e` | Open editor in worktree |
| `p` | Prune stale worktrees |
| `f` | Fetch all remotes |
| `r` | Refresh list |

### Branches Tab

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓` | Move down |
| `k` / `↑` | Move up |
| `Enter` | View branch details |
| `c` | Checkout branch |

### Add Worktree View

| `Esc` | Cancel |

---

## How It Works

### Adding a Worktree

Press `a` to open the add view:

1. **Type a branch name** — matching local branches appear as a dropdown
2. **Pick a suggestion** with `↑`/`↓` and `Enter`, or just hit `Enter` to create a new branch
3. **Path is optional** — press `Tab` to customize, or `Ctrl+O` to browse. Leave empty for auto-generated path

The default path is `../<repo-name>-<branch-name>` (sibling directory to your repo).

### Branch Management

Switch to the Branches tab with `→`. From there you can checkout, create, rename, delete, or merge branches — all without leaving the TUI.

## Requirements

- Git 2.15+
- A terminal with 256-color support
- Go 1.21+ only if building from source
- Optional: `zenity` on Linux for the native folder picker

---

## Configuration

`git-wtm` respects these environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `EDITOR` | `code` | Editor opened with `e` key |
| `SHELL` | `/bin/sh` | Shell opened with `o` key |

## Releasing

Releases are automated with [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/). On every version tag, GitHub Actions builds binaries for all platforms and publishes to Homebrew, Scoop, Chocolatey, and Winget automatically.

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
